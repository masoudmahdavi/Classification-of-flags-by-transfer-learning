# Classification of flags by transfer learning

This project is written on Kaggle notebook and the dataset is owned by this platform.
In this project, I imported the flags of the countries and chose among them, Iran and six neighbors of Iran, namely Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, Iraq, Pakistan, Turkey, and Turkmenistan, to train a model that can classify the flag images that these flags Which country are they for.
I used the ResNet50 pre-trained model and in the end, achieved an accuracy above 95%.
